# CSI281 Assignment 7

In this assignment you will be creating your own implementations of a stack and a queue using `std::list` as a backing store. You have less code written for you than in previous assignments and you will be implementing the tests yourself.

Your implementations, `Queue` and `Stack`, will subclass a provided abstract base class called `SequentialCollection`. Please use the intance variables from `SequentialCollection` instead of implementing your own. In fact, you are not allowed to add any instance variables to your subclasses. Please ensure you implement `push()`, `pop()`, and `peek()`. You will also write tests to ensure you have successfully implemented all of the required methods in `test.cpp`.

A large part of the grading of this assignment will be based on the tests you write. Your tests should be comprehensive and should test all of the method implemented in `Stack`, `Queue`, and `SequentialCollection`. You can learn how to write tests by looking at the tests I've written for previous assignments or by checking out the [Catch documentation](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).

Finally, there are 4 questions for you to answer in `questions.txt`.

## Basic Instructions

1. Create your own **private** repository from this repo by hitting the "Use this template" button at the top of the page
2. Add me (@davecom) as a collaborator on your **private** repository.
3. Implement the missing parts where it says "YOUR CODE HERE"
4. Test it on your local computer by following the build directions below
5. Run `nmake clean` or `make clean` to remove any binary files
6. Push your code to GitHub (Don't push your binary filesâ€”the purpose of the prior step is to remove them). Every push will be automatically tested on both Windows (nmake/MSVC) and Linux (GNUMake/GCC) through a GitHub Action. You will know your code is correct when you see a green check mark next to the commit on GitHub.
7. Answer all of the questions in `questions.txt` in your own file `answers.txt`.
8. Submit the URL to your private repository on Canvas. Submit even if you are not passing all tests so you can get partial credit.

## Standard Library Restrictions

Please do not use `<queue>`, `<stack>`, and `<deque>` from the standard library. You may use the rest of the standard library as much as you would like (and you are encouraged to).

## Directory Structure and Files

- `/` Main directory including this `README.md`, the build scripts, the make files, and `questions.txt`.
- `/lib` Library testing your work. There's no need to touch this.
- `/src` Source files, some of which you should modify and some of which you should not.

### Specific Files

*indicates do not modify
&indicates you must modify
%indicates you must create

- `GNUMakefile`* make file for GNU Make on macOS and GNU/Linux
- `Makefile`* make file for nmake/Visual Studio on Windows
- `README.md`* this file
- `LICENSE` MIT License
- `questions.txt`* Questions that you are expected to answer.
- `answers.txt`% Your answers to the questions in `questions.txt`

- `lib/catch.h`* a unit testing library

- `src/SequentialCollection.h`* the `SequentialCollection` abstract base class
- `src/Stack.h`& the `Stack` class
- `src/Queue.h`& the `Queue` class
- `src/main.cpp` the main file that runs the tests and makes the chart
- `src/test.cpp`& the unit tests to prove your code works

## Building and Running

### macOS and GNU/Linux

CD to the appropriate directory and run `make` and `./assignment7` to run all of the tests. Run `make clean` to remove all objects files, and the executable.

### Windows

From the start menu (assuming you have installed Visual Studio 2019) open the "Developer Command Prompt." CD to the appropriate directory and run `nmake` and `assignment7` to run all of the tests. Run `nmake clean` to remove all objects files, and the executable.

## Checklist for Submission

- [ ] Did you add me (@davecom) as a collaborator on the repository?
- [ ] Did you replace every area that said "YOUR CODE HERE" with your code?
- [ ] Did you ensure you are passing all of the unit tests? Do you see a green check mark on GitHub?
- [ ] Did you cite all sources, especially any place that you copied code from? Put code citations right next to where you inserted them.
- [ ] Did you add sufficient comments?
- [ ] Did you double check your code for good style?
- [ ] Did you remember to free any memory you manually allocated on the heap?
- [ ] Did you put your name below mine at the top of any files you modified and any other appropriate places?
- [ ] Did you try cleaning, building, and running once to make sure everything is in working order before submitting?
- [ ] If you were working with an IDE, did you test building on the command line with make or nmake? I will go by the tests of your work with make or nmake done automatically by the GitHub action.
- [ ] Did you check the repository is free of your object files and other garbage and just contains source files?
- [ ] Did you submit the URL to your repository on Canvas?
- [ ] Did you remember to include your `answers.txt` file with answers to every question?
